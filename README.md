# ðŸ“ˆStudents Performance in Exams:  EDA and  Visualization ðŸ“Š

Students Performance in Exams dataset consists of the marks secured by the students in various subjects.

## Why did I choose this dataset?

This was my first analysis and this dataset seemed easier to me than others

## What was my aim and did I succeed?

I wanted to observe how some features in the dataset (gender, race/ethnicity, course scores, etc..) make a difference in exams.

As a result of the analyzes and visualizations I made on the data set, I answered some questions that I was curious about.

For example;

* What is the effect of gender and education level on average score?
* What is the effect of gender and preparation course on average score?
* Which group is the most successful? (on average_score)


## What could I have done better ? (TO-DO)

* I will increase the variety of questions I want to know (i will ask a lot more questions to the dataset)
* Visualization techniques are poor. Should be improved.

## What did I learn from this analysis?
* Practice in exploratory data analysis, data manipulation and data visualization
* My graphic interpretation skills have improved
